<h1>MORNING.</h1>
<p><pre>
   Over is the night
   Cometh the sun
   Giving its sparkling light
   To the daughter and son

   This beautiful day
   Is really wanting
   May you make the hay
   While it’s shining

   Come off the bed
   The moment has come
   Only lay the dead
   The still and calm

   It’s another day
   So wake up and smile
   Successfully you may
   When you open the life file.</p>
